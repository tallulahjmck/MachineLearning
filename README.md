❤️ PROJECT 1: Mario Machine Learning

In this project I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to to tackle the problem of “Game Learning”. The goal of this task was to train Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents that receive image-inputs from a game simulator (Super Mario Bros), and that output game actions to play the game autonomously.

💚 PROJECT 2: Detection of Pneumonia in Medical Images

In this project I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to tackle the task of Detecting  Pneumonia in Medical Images. This task consists of creating image classifiers to predict whether there is pneumonia or not based on input x-ray images.
