❤️ PROJECT 1: Mario Machine Learning

In this project I used Python and Juypter Notebook to to tackle the problem of “Game Learning”. The goal of this task was to train Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents that receive image-inputs from a game simulator (Super Mario Bros), and that output game actions to play the game autonomously.
